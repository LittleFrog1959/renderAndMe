                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>This program is designed to support people gathering match stats during a basketball game.</p>

                <h4>Getting a user name</h4>
                <p>Right now, there's only one user name that works!  It's my name which is a word I can actually spell.</p>

                <h4>Setting up</h4>
                <p>Enter the names/numbers a squad (typically 18 people) and from this list, create a team (typically 12 people).  It is not necessary to know the names AND numbers of a player.  Either/both work fine.</p>

                <h4>Stats entry</h4>
                <p>Before entering any stats, select the players that will be on-court (typically 5 people).  Do this using the "Players" tab.</p>

                <p>Go to the "Ref events" tab to show the start and end of each quarter.  From here, you can also indicate timeouts and various other game events driven by the referee.</p>

                <p>During a quarter, use the "Game events" to enter key stats information.  Firtsly left-click on the court image to indicate the place where the event happened.  Then select a player and event.  Finally click on "Submit".</p>
